## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This project is an e-commerce product.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## Techonologies thta I used

- HTML

- CSS

- Javascript

## What's missing

- setting the lightbox gallery

- setting buttons to add and take the item of to the card

- make the landing page responsive
